# Pattern for output filename suitable for python's format function.
# Available variables:
# - basename The name of the input file without extension or path
# - ext      The file extension excluding dot (ex: '.nc4') (ex: '')
# - path     The path to the input file (ex: '../runtime') (ex: '.')
output_filename: './{basename}_elevated.nc4'

# Heights [m] at which to interpolate 3D variables
#heights:
#  #  - 10
#  - 50
#  - 80
#  - 100
#  - 150
#  - 5000
#  - 15000

# Interpolate to heights above ground rather than above sea-level
#height_type: above_ground

# Interpolate to heights above ground rather than above sea-level
#height_type: above_sea

# Heights [hPa] at which to interpolate 3D variables
heights:
  - 900
  - 750
  - 600
  - 500
  - 300

# Interpolate to heights above ground rather than above sea-level
height_type: pressure

# Variables to include
variables:
  # Shape of data space
  - Times
  - XLAT
  - XLONG
  - HGT
  - height

  # Native variables
  - TKE_PBL

  # Derived variables
  - temperature
  #- U_true
  #- V_true
  - wind_speed
  #- wind_dir
  - density

  - pressure  # should interpolate to ~constant when height_type is pressure
  - geopotential_height  # should interpolate to ~constant when height_type is above_sea
  - height_  # should interpolate to ~constant when height_type is above_ground

# Whether to apply chunking to the variables of the output file.
chunking: True

# Compression level for output file. 0 to disable, values 1-9 are passed to zlib
complevel: 0
