# Pattern for output filename suitable for python's format function.
# Available variables:
# - basename The name of the input file without extension or path
# - ext      The file extension excluding dot (ex: '.nc4') (ex: '')
# - path     The path to the input file (ex: '../runtime') (ex: '.')
output_filename: '{path}/{basename}_elevated.nc4'

# Altitudes [m] at which to interpolate 3D variables
heights:
  - 10  # TODO: Not available on bottom_top which would require extrapolation
  - 50
  - 80
  - 100
  - 150
  - 6500  # TODO: Weirdly gets all masked out

# Interpolate to heights above ground rather than above sea-level
above_ground: True  # TODO: r√°v2 file does not have HGT. Support --height-from= argument for external file

# Variables to include
variables:
  #- height     # Write the heights array above as a 1-D variable
  #- U_true     # TODO: derived variable
  #- V_true     # TODO: derived variable
  #- wind_speed # TODO: derived variable
  #- wind_dir   # TODO: derived variable
  #- density    # TODO: derived variable
  #- U           # TODO: replace with U_true  Needs to be destaggered west_east
  #- V           # TODO: replace with V_true  Needs to be destaggered south_north
