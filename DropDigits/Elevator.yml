# Pattern for output filename suitable for python's format function.
# Available variables:
# - basename The name of the input file without extension or path
# - ext      The file extension excluding dot (ex: '.nc4') (ex: '')
# - path     The path to the input file (ex: '../runtime') (ex: '.')
output_filename: '{path}/{basename}_elevated.nc4'

# Altitudes [m] at which to interpolate 3D variables
heights:
  - 10  # TODO: Not available on bottom_top which would require extrapolation
  - 29
  - 50
  - 80
  - 100
  - 150
  #- 5000
  #- 15000

# Interpolate to heights above ground rather than above sea-level
above_ground: True  # TODO: Support --geo-from= argument to read HGT, XLAT, XLONG from external file if missing

# Variables to include
variables:
  # Shape of model space
  - Times
  #- XLAT       # TODO: Not present in some test data
  #- XLONG
  #- height     # TODO: Write the heights array above as a 1-D variable

  # Native variables
  #- U           # replaced by U_true in earth co-ordinates
  #- V           # replaced by V_true in earth co-ordinates
  #- T           # replaced by temp which is real temperature
  - TKE_PBL

  # Derived variables
  - temperature
  - U_true
  - V_true
  - wind_speed
  - wind_dir
  - density

# Whether to terminate processing if an input variable is missing
# terminate_on_missing: False  # TODO: Not implemented

# Whether to apply chunking to the variables of the output file.
chunking: True

# Compression level for output file. 0 to disable, values 1-9 are passed to zlib
